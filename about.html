                            <p>
                                When it comes to being sick, there are two kinds of people in this world: 
                                those who want comfort, and those who want to get better. We make medicine 
                                for the second kind.<br><br>They know life is too good to miss hiding under the covers.
                                When they're sick, they want to feel like themselves, again more than they want 
                                to feel sorry for themselves. It's why they'd rather take the fast way, than the easy way.
                                <br><br>This is who buys our medicine. And we never forget it. Because it's clarifying. 
                                It means that we just have to make what works, and not apologize for how.
                                <br><br>And it means we don't have to be distracted with salesmanship. That's for snake oil. 
                                "Build a better mousetrap," they say, "and the world will beat a path to your door."
                                <br><br>That's the way it's been for our medicine. Which is why we're so confident when we say, 
                                "Let the people who love you give you comfort. We're here to make you better."

                                    <h2>A History Of Bad Taste</h2>
                                    <p>The creation of Buckley's® Mixture was a classic case of recognizing a good thing. 
                                        When pharmacist William Knapp Buckley took over a Toronto drugstore in 1919, 
                                        he discovered several natural ingredients used in the treatment of coughs and colds.<br><br> 
                                        As a pharmacist, W.K. recognized the ingredients' merits and combined them to create 
                                        a unique and effective remedy, which he called Buckley's® Mixture. Never one to hesitate 
                                        in the face of opportunity, he formed W.K. Buckley Limited on March 20, 1920, and began
                                         marketing his product.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="historyimg" id="para1"></div>
                                <!--para2-->

                                        <h2>Pioneering Marketing Strategies</h2>
                                        <p>Realizing the power of catchy copy and smart media buying, W.K. concentrated his efforts
                                            on print and radio advertising to sell his product. Considering this was an era when 
                                            advertising was a relatively new and poorly understood phenomenon, W.K. was ahead of his 
                                            time. As his son, Frank Buckley, points out, "My father was first and foremost a born salesman." 
                                            Frank Buckley believes that smart use of national radio in the early days of broadcasting built
                                            the business and was a key factor in establishing Buckley's® as a household name.<br><br>
                                            The 1920s was a period of rapid growth at W.K. Buckley Limited with new products being 
                                            introduced and distributed throughout Canada. Despite this growth, W.K.'s Drugstore in Toronto 
                                            remained the headquarters for development of new products, including products outside the cough & cold 
                                            category.<br><br> When the Great Depression hit, many of the secondary products were discontinued and W.K. Buckley Limited 
                                            went back to what it did best: cough & cold preparations. During the Depression, the company introduced a 
                                            smaller size of Buckley's® Mixture, priced at a more manageable 40 cents to help consumers through those 
                                            lean years. It was during this period that W.K. introduced his "medicine chest in a jar," Buckley's® White Rub.

                                        <p> With the success the company was having in Canada, W.K. decided to expand his horizons by 
                                            taking Buckley's® Mixture to the Global Market. Buckley's® was introduced in the United

                                        <h2>Facing New Challenges</h2>
                                        <p> By the 60s, it was clear that pharmacies were changing rapidly. The pharmaceutical industry
                                            saw the transition from small individually owned drugstores to drug supermarkets. Another 
                                            change was the discovery of advertising by the other traditional and ethical pharmaceutical 
                                            companies.<br><br> The pioneering marketing and creative advertising strategies that had made Buckley's 
                                            so successful and unique among the rest of the category were now being used by everyone. Buckley's 
                                            no longer held that creative competitive edge. As a result, sales began sliding.<br><br>
                                            Frank Buckley realized something had to be done. In the early 80s, the company decided on what he calls,
                                            "the back to basics" strategy. Put simply, radio and print media had built the business, so Buckley's 
                                            would use it to build it again.

                                        <h2>The Bad Taste Campaign</h2>
                                        <p> After much discussion, it was agreed that Buckley's® Mixture possessed two strong characteristics: 
                                            lousy taste and tremendous efficacy. Using these two characteristics, they produced an award-winning 
                                            advertising campaign that made Buckley's® Mixture and Frank Buckley household names in Canada.<br><br>
                                            The campaign-slogan was "It tastes awful. And it works."® In 1986, the first transit ads featuring
                                            Frank Buckley quipping, "I came by my bad taste honestly - I inherited it from my father" and 
                                            "I wake up with nightmares that someone gives me a taste of my own medicine," ran nationally. 
                                            The company's simple, honest, and humorous approach to advertising helped attract much attention 
                                            and praise, but more importantly, new users.<br><br>
                                            The "bad taste" campaign increased the Buckley's company's market share over 10% in the Canadian 
                                            cough & cold category and has won numerous advertising awards. They also successfully implemented 
                                            this campaign in the Caribbean, Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S.

                                <p>Frank Buckley, born in Toronto on April 8, 1921, likes to believe he was
                                    conceived around the same time his father, William Knapp Buckley founded 
                                    W.K. Buckley Limited (1920).<br><br>At the Buckley's® company, Frank began
                                    his career working as a traveling salesman. After three years of door-to-door
                                    sales, he joined his father in a management position. While W.K. was first 
                                    and foremost a salesman, Frank had a natural interest in finance, administration,
                                    and broadcast media. Together, they made a formidable team. Upon the death of
                                    his father in 1978, Frank assumed presidency of the company.<br><br>Frank became 
                                    spokesperson in the mid 80s, when the company implemented its honest and humorous 
                                    "awful taste" ad campaign. Featured in many of the radio and TV commercials, 
                                    he is often recognized and approached by people in public for a casual comment 
                                    or autograph. Senior citizens are attracted to Frank as living proof that life 
                                    starts, not ends, at 65. Frank remains spokesperson for the Buckley's® brand, today.
                                    <br><br>Frank has always shown keen interest in the pharmaceutical industry. 
                                    He served as President of the Proprietary Association of Canada 
                                    (now the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association of Canada) 
                                    and remains an honorary member to this day. Throughout his life, 
                                    Frank has also been involved with many community service organizations.<br><br>
                                    Frank graduated with a bachelor of commerce and finance degree from the 
                                    University of Toronto in 1942. He served in the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm 
                                    as a carrier-based fighter pilot in World War II. In 2003, Frank was deeply 
                                    honoured to be appointed a member of the Order of Canada.
